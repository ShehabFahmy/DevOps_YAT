##### List all running processes
```
ps aux
```
- `ps`: is the process status command.
- `a`: displays information about other users' processes as well as your own.
- `u`: displays the processes belonging to the specified usernames.
- `x`: includes processes that do not have a controlling terminal.
or use `top` for a specific user:
```
top -u user
```
---
##### Kill a process
1) Get the process ID (firefox for example)
```
ps -e | grep -i firefox
```
or
```
pgrep firefox
```
2) Kill the process by sending a kill signal (`SIGKILL`)
```
kill -9 [PID]
```
or you can simply do that in 1 step:
```
kill -9 $(pgrep firefox)
```
or you can use `pkill` command to kill by process name:
```
pkill firefox
```
---
##### Priority of processes
Assume you want to run a script with a higher priority to make the CPU allocate more time and focus on that script.
You can use `nice` command:
```
nice -n 3 ./test.sh
```
The higher the nice value, the lower the priority and vice versa.

After some time you want to change the priority of that script **without closing the process**, so you enter `htop` command and start looking for that process's ID, then you can use `renice` command:
```
renice -n [new_nice] -p [PID]
```
