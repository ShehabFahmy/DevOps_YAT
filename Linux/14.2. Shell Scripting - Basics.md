## Variables
#### Variable Names
- Must start with a letter or underscore
- No special characters (e.g. @, #, %, $)
- Case sensitive
- Allowed: `VARIABLE, VAR123able,  var_name, _var`
- Not allowed: `1var, %name, $myvar, myvar-1`
To reference a variable, prepend `$` to its name (e.g. $PATH).
#### Global (Environmental) Variables
- Inherited by subshells.
- Example: `PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DISPLAY`
- `printenv/env`: to list the current environmental variables in your system.
#### Local Variables
- Only visible to the current shell.
- Not inherited by subshells.
#### Editing Variables

| Type                 | `sh/ksh/bash`     | `csh/tcsh`        |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Shell (local)        | name=value        | set name=value    |
| Environment (global) | export name=value | setenv name value |

| With `export`                                     | Without `export`                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `export v1=one`<br>`bash`<br>`echo $v1`<br>-> one | `v1=one`<br>`bash`<br>`echo $v1`<br>-> |
#### Inherit the Variables in a Script
Using the `source` command, it has a synonym in dot `.` (period).
Example:
```bash
. filename [arguments]
```
- The script does not need [[07. Permissions and Ownership#File Permissions|execute permission]] in this case. Commands are executed in the current shell process, so any changes made to your environment will be visible when the script finishes execution.
- Executing will run the commands in a new shell process (subshell).
#### Some Environment Variables

#### Quotations

| Type             | Mark    | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Single quotation | `'`     | Preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes.                                                                                       |

| Back quotation   | `` ` `` | Command substitution: allows the output of a command to replace the command itself, enclosed string is executed as a command, almost the same as `$()` |
Example:
```bash
str1='echo $USER'
echo "$str1"
```
-> `echo $USER`
```bash
str2="echo $USER"
echo "$str2"
```
-> `echo xUser`

```bash
str3=$(echo $USER)
echo "$str3"
```
-> `xUser`

## Arithmetic Operations

| Operation      | Operator       |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Addition       | +              |
| Subtraction    | -              |
| Multiplication | *              |
| Division       | /              |
| Exponentiation | ** (bash only) |
| Modulo         | %              |
#### Integer Arithmetic Operations
- `$(()) or $[]` commands:
	- `x=$((1+2))`
	- `echo $[x*x]`
- `let` command:
	- `let c=$x+$x`: no spaces
	- `let c=x+x`: you can omit the `$` sign
	- `let c="x + x"`: can have spaces
	- `let c+=1` or `let --c`: C-style increment operators
- `expr` command:
	- `expr 10 / 2`: space required
#### Floating-point Arithmetic Operations
GNU basic calculator (`bc`) external calculator:
- Add two numbers:
```bash
echo "3.8 + 4.2" | bc
```
- Divide two numbers and print result with a precision of 5 digits:
```bash
echo "scale=5; 2/5" | bc
```
- Convert between decimal and binary numbers:
```bash
echo "ibase=10; obase=2; 10" | bc
```
- Call `bc` directly:
```bash
bc <<< "scale=5; sqrt(2)"
```
## Arrays
Bash supports one-dimensional arrays:
- Index starts at 0
- No space around "="
#### Initialization
```bash
my_array=("Alice" "Bill" "Cox" "David")
```
or
```bash
my_array[0]="Alice"; my_array[1]="Bill"
```
#### Reference an Element
```bash
${my_array[i]}   # Must include curly braces
```
#### Print the Whole Array
```bash
echo ${my_array[@]}
```
#### Length of Array
```bash
echo ${#my_array[@]}
```
#### Add an Element to an Existing Array
- Prepend
```bash
my_array=("first" "${my_array[@]}")
```
- Append
```bash
my_array=("${my_array[@]}" "last")
```
- Insert at Index
```bash
my_array[4]="Nason"
```
***Note:*** double quotation can be omitted in case of one element or it will add each word (separated by a space) as a new element.
#### Copy the Current Array to a New Array
```bash
new_array=(${my_array[@]})   # braces can be omitted
```
#### Concatenate two Arrays
```bash
two_arrays=(${my_array[@]} ${new_array[@]})
```
#### Delete the Entire Array
```bash
unset my_array
```
#### Delete an Element from an Existing Array
```bash
unset my_array[0]
```
